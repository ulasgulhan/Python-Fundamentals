# Python_Fundamentals

I've organized the training materials I received at Bilge Adam under the 'lab' folder. During this period, I learned the fundamentals of Python, Django, machine learning, data analysis, and FastApi. Additionally, I've completed Harvard's CS50P course. Furthermore, I've shared my own Hackerrank projects in this repository.
